	Handle "iffy" images from partclone.  Specifically, handle
	inconsistencies between the used block count in the header and the
	number of blocks marked in the bitmap.  Also, change interpretation of
	the bitmap to match partclone: 1 = used; not 1 = unused.

	Trivial change from initial revision - check for <sys/capability.h> and
	use that to switch the checking of capabilities on and off.
