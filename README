This is the partclone-utils package, a library and utility to access
and mount images generated by partclone, ntfsclone and raw (dd) images.

Synopsis
--------
Using imagemount, you can create a network block device that reads
blocks from the raw, partclone or ntfsclone image.  Optionally, you can enable
write support so that written changes are saved to a change file so that the
original image remains unchanged.  Further, imagemount can also issue
the mount(2) and umount[2](2) syscalls to mount and unmount the block
device in the filesystem.
